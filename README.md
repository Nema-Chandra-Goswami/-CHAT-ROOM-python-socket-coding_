	 The term chat room, or chatroom, is primarily used to describe any form of synchronous conferencing, occasionally even asynchronous conferencing. The term can thus mean any 		technology ranging from real-time online chat and online interaction with strangers (e.g., online forums) to fully immersive graphical social environments.
	The primary use of a chat room is to share information via text with a group of other users. Generally speaking, the ability to converse with multiple people in the same 	conversation differentiates chat rooms from instant messaging programs, which are more typically designed for one-to-one communication. The users in a particular chat 			room are generally connected via a shared internet or other similar connection, and chat rooms exist catering for a wide range of subjects. New technology has enabled the use 		of file sharing and webcams to be included in some programs. This would be considered a chat room.
